<h3>About Me</h3>
I am a technically oriented and highly inquisitive programmer and system administrator

My claim to fame is my ability to fix things, whether it's a broken software environment, a finnicky cable, a wobbly leg or a cryptic bash script. I am not afraid to open my toolbox and take out my screwdriver, soldering iron, hex editor and packet sniffer and get to work. When presented with a problem I do not tire in unravelling the details and finding a solution, where many an all-nighter have been spent.

While I am interested in any technical challenge presented to me I have particular interests in system automation, language design, and the 'internet of things'.

I love taking things apart and that is where my love of software and hardware stems from. I am a big proponent of open source software and hardware.

When I am not fiddling with my technology I enjoy singing, playing my guitars and <a href="#" onclick='loadContent("books.md");'>reading</a>.
