Here are some books that I have thoroughly enjoyed. This is nowhere near a complete list and titles will be added as they pop into mind or are read ;)

* Atlas Shrugged - *Ayn Rand*
* Mars Trilogy (Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars) - *Kim Stanley Robinson*
* Metamagical Themas - *Douglas Hofstadter*
* Ender's Game - *Orson Scott Card*
